# CourseKtorServer
This application is a Ktor-based server that provides a REST API for managing course information. 
It can be used to communicate with an Android application via API calls, but it can also be used to display information directly in a web browser. 
The application only runs on a local network, making it accessible mainly from devices connected to the same network.
